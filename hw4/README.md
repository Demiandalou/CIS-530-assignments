# Neural Language Models
### Data Preparation
- All needed data are printed as a tree which is shown in the end of this file.
- Download the cities_name dataset and extract to the root folder
- Download the Jane Austen novels dataset and the ABC music format dataset
	- wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rdeese/tunearch-corpus/master/all-abcs.txt -O ABC_music.txt
	- wget http://www.gutenberg.org/files/31100/31100.txt -O Jane_austen.txt
- Find the Lord of the rings dataset from submission

### Run Character-Level Recurrent Neural Networks
- Use the command below
	python main_classify.py --train --plot --eval --test
- This will run the model using a learning rate of 0.0005, 400,000 iterations, 256 hidden layer size, and SGD optimizer.
- With the plot flag, it shows a plot of training and validation loss and a plot of validation accuracy as the model is training.
- With the eval flag, it prints the accuracy of the model on the development dataset and shows a plot of confusion matrix.

### Run Text Generation model
- Use the command below
	python main_generate.py --train --eval --plot --perplexity
- This will run the model using a learning rate of 0.005, 2000 epochs, 100 hidden layer size, and Adam optimizer.
- With the plot flag, it shows a plot of training loss as the model is training.
- With the eval flag, it prints the text generated by the model when temperature is 0.2, 0.8, and 1.4.
- With the perplexity flag, it prints the perplexity score on the similar dataset and the dissimilar dataset, since evaluating the whole dataset takes too long, the flag randomly evaluate a chunk.
